## Abstract

This document describes how `aspects` will be defined for and connected with
bears and how their results will be annotated with them.

This cEP also provides a list of the `aspects` to be implemented with their
correspponding `tastes` where taste are customization `settings` for `aspects`.

## Introduction

An `aspect` is an analysis we want to run over a piece of code. As stated in
[cEP-0005](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md), one of the
main problems coala faces is its configuration due to the huge number of bears
it offers, which are capable of analyzing several aspects of code and are
sometimes highly configurable with numerous settings; whereby the user has to
be aware of which bear does what and which setting has be to set to analyze
the aspect he wants analyzed; resulting in a coala difficult to learn and use.

To make things easier for user the concept of `aspects` was created as proposed
in [cEP-0005](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md). Our goal
here is to list all the aspects for covering all the code anlysis features the
coala bears are capable of, annotating bears' results with them.

## The aspests

The bears offered by coala are usually capable of handling several aspects.
`aspects` will be implemented in a tree-like form starting with the
[Root aspect](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/aspects/root.py).
Here is the list of aspects to be implemented along with their corresponding
`subaspects` and tastes(which are the leaves of the tree written
in snake_case).

## Implementation

As stated previously the aspects will be implemented in a tree like form,
with the Root aspect at the root of the tree. Some classes, metaclasses
and some few methods were define so far to make that possible including:

* [the aspectbase class](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/aspects/base.py)
* [the Documentation class for documenting aspects](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/aspects/docs.py)
* [the aspectclass metaclass](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/aspects/meta.py)
* [the TasteMeta class](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/aspects/taste.py)
* [the Taste class](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/bearlib/aspects/taste.py)

`aspects` will simply be defined this way:
```python
from coalib.bearlib.aspects import Root, Taste


@Root.subaspect
class SomeAspect:

    # This will serve as documentation for the aspect
    class docs:
        example = 'an example of this aspect of code'
        example_language = 'the programming language of the example'
        importance_reason = 'the reason why this is important'
        fix_suggestions = ''

    # Here we define the different tastes for this aspect
    # aspects are not compelled to have tastes
    some_taste = Taste[Taste_type](
        'Documentation about this taste',
        list('Possible value for this taste',),
        default='Default value for this taste')
```
The documentation of each of the implemented aspects will be added to
the [coala/aspect-docs](https://github.com/coala/aspect-docs) repository.

Concerning bears' results annotation, so far, the `.aspect` attr was added to
the [Result class](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/master/coalib/results/Result.py)
(where a Result object is what is yielded by a bear when through executing).
So annotating a bear's result with aspects simply consists of setting this
variable to the appropriate aspect of code.
Here is how bears' will be defined in as presented in
[cEP-0005](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md).

```python
from coalib.bears.LocalBear import LocalBear
from coalib.results.Result import Result
from coalib.bearlib.aspects import Root


class RedundancyBear(LocalBear, aspects={
        # This represents all the aspects this bear can detect.
        'detect': [Root.Redundancy.Clone],
        # This represents all the aspects this bear can fix.
        'fix': [Root.Redundancy.UnusedImport]},
        languages=['C', 'Python']):

    def run(self, filename, file, aspects):
        # No documentation required anymore for the bears.

        if unused_imports(file):
            # A bear may yield results for any aspect even if it's not selected.
            # coala will filter out only selected aspects.
            yield Result.from_values(aspect=Root.Redundancy.UnusedImport, ...)

        # Bears can save performance by only performing needed checks
        aspect = aspects.get(Root.Redundancy.Clone, False)
        if aspect:
            # Bears can access tastes right from the aspect instance
            min_clone_tokens = aspect.min_clone_tokens

            # The aspect is tied to the result. coala now knows everything from
            # the aspect documentation!
            yield Result.from_values(aspect=aspect, ...)
```
